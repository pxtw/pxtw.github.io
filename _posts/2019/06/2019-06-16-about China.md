<span style="background-color: white; color: #111111; font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hello Nathan, I am a local Chinese and I am here to disagree with you.

Firstly, do you think drinking alcohol in public is a wide consensus of the whole human race ? And then what about freedom of speech?

Secondly, the biggest reason why I disagree with you and also the MOST IMPORTANT BUG of China is THERE IS NO 
Judicial independence even the gov announced  ALMOST IN PUBLIC they didn't think Judicial independence is a good way to lead China prosperous and stable instead of following the leadship of CCP.

People living in the base have no actual right to engage with the law making. But the CCP's subjective consciousness does which is manipulated directly or indirectly by the toppest man or org of China's politc. This means the fundamental judgement of gov's behavior can not be setup.People who are able to write the law ARE ALWAYS RIGHT even if they are doing bad things on wide consensus of the world and more even they are on supervision by other countries. Isn't it ridiculous and horrible?

There are 3 common situations.
1. They make a bad or controversial law pass. And they do things allowing to the law. When other countries critique it, they say they do things legally.
2. They make a wide hooked law which makes everyone can easily violate it.And as long as they need,you will be wanted. And ALL OF THIS IS A LEGAL PROCEDURAL.
3. To some big controversial issue (Which can actually benifit the country self but violate the consensus of wide people),such as banning itself from the Internet.

They do it secretly even though we all know that they do it. But there is never a agency to come out to take responsiblity to it.If you ask the gov, they must tell you the foreign Internet companies violated laws. And you shall get none specific law rules because maybe they are making up it.

Thirdly, do you ever try to look up there is any law violation of facebook in China? Or you just think China gov always have right say "You are not welcome, because I am the owner of this house!"? 

I think you make wrong understanding that all China's behaviors are just from a sane man who care about himself only.But the fact is not, the behaviors are unstable because they are the result of interst game of a mysterious organization. But the 1.4 billion people are influenced by the behaviors' results.

Finally, as a local man here.I have to say China's gov is not a demon to people at least they didn't act like one in my 2 decades life.They just do things for the interst between the whole Chinese people and CCP itself but under no limitation which presents a weird and unreasonable behavior to people in free country. I actually is seeing the progressing of China our gov makes. It's totally our gov's credit because we tiny people can not change anything. It makes economic progress, I feel good. It limits people's freedom even arrest people illegally, I hope tommorrow it could be better. It's complecated, it's really complecated.

For my personal safety, I will delete this comment in few days. I hope I can let you guys know the real China is more.And I hope you guys can duplicated this comment and share as your own comment to let more people about China if you agree with my point.</span>
